<h2>MY ROLE MODEL</h2>
<h3>My role model is my mother.
    My mother is my first teacher, my advisor, and my support system.
    She has always been there for me through thick and thin.
    She is a beautiful person inside and out.
    She is an excellent cook; she has taught me to respect food and people.
    She is my role model because she gives me strength and motivates me.
    She inspires me to become a good human being and a caring child.
    My mother has always helped us and made us believe in ourselves.
    She is the most understanding person of all the people I know.
    My mother has made many sacrifices in her life to nurture us, hence she is the biggest role model in my life.
